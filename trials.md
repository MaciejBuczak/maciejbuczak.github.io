##### Evolution of Research Approach
The foundation of my way of thinking and acting is a broad interest in the world and the ways in which humans can explain and understand it—regardless of how scientifically grounded these methods are. My professional practice has allowed me to increasingly recognize the emerging characteristics of the surrounding reality:  
(a) The world has reached a level of complexity that is non-linear to the individual mind,  
(b) The methods used to describe this world often fail when stochastic components play a significant role, and they do not withstand real-world collisions,  
(c) We often build models that are less complex than the phenomena they aim to describe.
