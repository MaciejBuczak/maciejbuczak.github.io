        Backward step in the development of unexpected value modeling concepts in the financial sector: a
case study of the decision to withdraw the ama framework in operational Risk
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="publication-description">In this article, I present my high-level perspective on the decision to withdraw the entire modeling framework from banking sector applications. I have been dealing with this topic for several years. The framework in question is something I have thoroughly explored, both from the perspective of general business objectives and every detailed aspect of its modeling space. I therefore understand the reasons behind the decision to discontinue this concept.</p>

        Unexpected effects inherent in the AMA concept, determining its quality and ultimate withdrawal
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="publication-description">The article presents a very detailed analysis of the AMA method, set within the framework of statistical and
mathematical concepts. In this publication, I derive three properties that, in my opinion, went unnoticed during the
method's 20 years of operation, which were built into this method, probably unintentionally. They were the result of
themethod's overcomplexity and ultimately, as I argue, themain reason for the loss of confidence in thismethod.</p>
