### Tekst
I would like to present arguments that point to the "built-in" defects in the AMA concept defined by the supervisor, which led to such a loss of credibility of the method. Thus, the imperfection of the framework, and above all, its unjustified overcomplexity, materialized in the form of such a dispersion of results that exceeded the supervisory boundary of acceptability.
