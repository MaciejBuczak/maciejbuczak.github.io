I'm glad you're here. I enjoy sharing knowledge and experience in applications of quantitative methods in risk analysis and beyond... I am a researcher and manager with many years of experience in this field. I've managed to capture many interesting observations. I co-created an IT system for operational risk management, developed a model risk management system, and spent most of my time on various statistical analyses. For 8 years, I was involved in holistic model evaluation in terms of their exposure to model risk. My main areas are credit risk (ECL/IFRS9), operational risk and statistical techniques for its measurement, measurement of expected and unexpected values (internal capital). I'm also actively looking for other spaces for qualitative-quantitative reflection...

I still work in business, in the banking sector. Additionally, in terms of teaching, I collaborate with Warsaw universities:

I am pleased to announce the publication of my article "Backward Step in the Development of Unexpected Value Modeling Concepts in the Financial Sector: A Case Study of the Decision to Withdraw the AMA Framework in Operational Risk" in the journal Quantitative Methods in Economics (Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW). The article addresses two decades of this method's implementation in the banking sector. In it, I formulate a critical assessment of the framework developed by the regulator, and I identify this framework as the main cause of the method's failure and the regression in the process of quantitative methods saturation in the banking sector.

      <p class="aktualnosc-description">
        The direct motivation for writing this article was my application for an assistant position at the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW). A much deeper motivation was my interest in describing reality as an attempt to capture its shapes, those that constitute large-scale events. I am particularly interested in the deeper causes hidden beneath the mask of well-known historical events that are behind two events: the fall of the First Polish Republic and the outbreak of World War I. This article is an attempt to build a conceptual framework, a bold one - I admit, based on statistical concepts and ideas, which could further serve to describe reality in the context of the causes of the aforementioned events (which is an even bolder undertaking). For now, I have finished my work on the conceptual framework described above, without historical references and backtests.

        This article is a precise indication of the main effects I have identified that had a decisive influence on the low effectiveness and credibility of the statistical method used to model operational risk (AMA method). Unlike the previous article "Backward Step...", which focused on a high-level, qualitative assessment, this one is firmly grounded in statistical methods.
